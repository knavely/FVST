This is code to accompany the paper: A 7/3-APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM FOR FEEDBACK VERTEX SET IN TOURNAMENTS VIA SHERALI-ADAMS 
by Manuel Aprile, Matthew Drescher, Samuel Fiorini, Tony Huynh. Pre-print https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08779

Showing:
1. There are 121 tournaments of size 7 which require 3 vertices to hit all directed cycles.
2. Exactly 1 of which is "heavy".

Requires having ```sage``` installed. See https://www.sagemath.org/ .

To run ```$ python T_Seven.py``` or use ```$ ipython run T_Seven.py``` and call the functions interactively.
